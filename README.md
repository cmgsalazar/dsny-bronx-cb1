# Department of Sanitation data 

This repository contains datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) in relation to the Melrose, Mott Haven, and Port Morris neighborhoods in the South Bronx (also: Bronx Community District 1) â€” my coverage area for Craft class at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.

Here, I also keep notebooks I used to analyze the data.
