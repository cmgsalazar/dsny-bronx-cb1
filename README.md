# Department of Sanitation data 

This repository contains Department of Sanitation (DSNY) datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), which I analyzed in relation to the Melrose, Mott Haven, and Port Morris neighborhoods in the South Bronx (Bronx Community District 1) â€” my coverage area for Craft class at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
